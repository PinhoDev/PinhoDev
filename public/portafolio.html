          <h3>App Top News</h3>
          <p>
            I developed an application that allows users to view the most
            relevant news by categories of a specific country, which by default
            is set to the US. Users caSn easily switch between different
            categories such as politics, sports, technology, and entertainment
            to find the news that interests them the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the application provides detailed information about
            each news article, including the publication date, author, and a
            brief summary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users can also click on a link to open the full article in their
            browser, allowing them to read the complete story from the original
            source. This application aims to provide a convenient and
            comprehensive way for users to stay informed about current events
            from around the world.

          <h3>App Tour Guide</h3>
          <p>
            I developed an application that enables users to view tours,
            flights, rental cars, and hotels stored in a database. Users can
            access relevant details about these tours, flights, rental cars, and
            hotels, such as pricing, availability, and customer reviews. The
            application features a user-friendly interface that allows for easy
            navigation and filtering of search results based on user
            preferences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, it includes a secure booking system that integrates
            with various payment gateways, ensuring a seamless and safe
            transaction process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The backend is built with robust technologies to handle large
            volumes of data efficiently, providing users with real-time updates
            and accurate information.

          <h3>App Police Incidents</h3>
          <p>
            I have developed an application that allows users to locate
            incidents and police stations in a specific country, Sweden in this
            case. The application provides a comprehensive database of
            incidents, including details such as the type of incident, date,
            time, and severity. Users can search for incidents based on various
            criteria, such as location, date range, and type of incident. The
            map features real-time updates, allowing users to see the most
            current information available.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the application enables users to pinpoint these
            incidents and police stations on an interactive map, providing a
            visual representation of the data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users can also get directions to the nearest police station and view
            contact information for emergency services. The application aims to
            enhance public safety by providing easy access to critical
            information and helping users stay informed about incidents in their
            area.
